# CodeOptimization-and-ComputingSkills

## Introduction
This is a folder to used to save some skill of code optimization and calculation
1. **[L2-norm]** = Matrix-calculation of L2-norm  
>[PDF] 矩阵2范数的循环计算转换为矩阵计算.pdf is to illustrate the mathematical principles;   
>[Code] [SVR_example.m](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/73706-support-vector-regression-ls-svr-for-non-linear-functions) --ref--> Ludovico Cuoghi (2022). Support Vector Regression ( LS-SVR) for Non Linear functions.;  
>[Code] demo.m/lssvr_predict.m/lssvr_train.m is coded by myself and the optimization is used in these codes.
