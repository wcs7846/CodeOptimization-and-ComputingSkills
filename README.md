# CodeOptimization-and-ComputingSkills

## Introduction
This is a folder to used to save some skill of code optimization and calculation
1. **[L2-norm]** = Matrix-calculation of L2-norm

>[Code] demo.m/lssvr_predict.m/lssvr_train.m is coded by myself and the optimization is used in these codes.   

## Purpose

This is a storehouse to share some runnable codes and some computing skills about some algorithms.  
I will upgrade the storehouse when I have some free time or have some new codes, but not periodically. So please don't push the author !!!

[Tips] the algorithm codes in this folder are written by myself, but I will use some function from some toolbox. Thanks for predecessor!!

## History
2022-4-26  update "Matrix-calculation of L2-norm" pdf and code.
